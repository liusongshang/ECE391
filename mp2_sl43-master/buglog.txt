Bug 1
  Type: Algorithm error
  Description: Moving left and right leads to uncomplete photo.
  Difficulty: 15 mins; change the loop which writes to buffer.
  
Bug 2
  Type: Algorithm error
  Description: When showing status message, there's another bar appearing on the top.
  Difficulty: 30mins; change the position of function.
  (put the show_statusbar() function the show_screen())
Bug 3
  Type: Algorithm error
  Description: After implenting typed cmd parf, the bar blinks and appears at the top once again.
  Difficulty: a whole night; rewrite the implenting methods, main reason is the target img Switching.

Bug 4
  Type: Semantic error (Segmentation FAULT)
    "Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    [Switching to Thread -1208310080 (LWP 1673)]
    0x08048da1 in game_loop () at adventure.c:253
    253                     strcat(typingcmd,"_");"
   Difficulty: 30-60 mins; rewrite the concatation with a more stupied but easier understanding way.

Bug 5 
  Type: Semantic error (Segmentation FAULT)
    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    [Switching to Thread -1209014592 (LWP 3621)]
    0x0062eab3 in strcpy () from /lib/libc.so.6
   Difficulty: 30-60mins; rewrite the copy woth a traditional loop way.
Bug 6
  Type: Semantic error
    Description: When typing several words, the typing command beomes chaos.
    Difficulty: more than 1h. The reason is that the char[]is not large enough, the stack overflows.
    Rewrite the interfaces of two functions in text.c. Add a paramenter "size" into it.
Bug 7
  Type: Algorithm error
  Description: the characters are not shown correctly on the status bar.
  Difficulty: one afternoon. Revise the method of writing to memory( almost revise a function).
MP2.2

Bug 8
  Type: Semantic error
  Description: Segmentation fault with octree
  Difficulty: 10-30 mins. change the pointer the structure
Bug 9
  Type: Semantic error
  Description: can't build world
  Difficult: more than one hour. Didn't initialize the necessary attribute 
Bug 10
  Type:Algorithm error
  Description: the color is almost green
  Difficulty: more than one hour.  misunderstand the color palette. forget to revise 5:6:5 to 6:6:6
Bug 11
  Type:Algorithm error
  Description: the color is almost dimmer
  Difficulty: more than one afternoon. Didn't understand how qsort() make use of compar function. 
  Wrong use of return value
Bug 12
   Type:Algorithm error
   Description: the tux can't show the time. something is wrong with the LED Set.
   Difficulty:  one night+one morning. It's the problem of design. Didn't push the FIFTEEN to the buffer.
